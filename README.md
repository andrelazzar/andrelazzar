- 👋 Hi, I’m Andreea and I am a Junior QA tester.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Testing, but also in finding solutions on how my team and I can make the product a more reliable and safer one.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning API testing, continuing with SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow curious Junior testers like me to grow amd learn extras.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending me an email at: andre.lazzar91@gmail.com
